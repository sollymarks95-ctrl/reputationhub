  const prompt = `Generate ${count} realistic customer reviews for ${company.name} (${company.category}, regulated: ${company.regulation}).
Company: ${company.description}

Rules:
- ${posCount} positive reviews (rating 4-5), ${negCount} negative/neutral (rating 2-3)
- Each review: specific, mentions regulation/features/real experience, 80-180 words
- Mention the regulation (${company.regulation}) naturally in at least 2 reviews
- Vary reviewer perspectives: beginner, active trader, long-term investor, etc.
- Sound genuinely human, not marketing copy

Return ONLY valid JSON array, no markdown:
